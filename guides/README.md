- [Arrays](./arrays.md)
- [BFS (Breadth-First Search)](./bfs.md)
- [Backtracking](./backtracking.md)
- [Binary Search](./binary-search.md)
- [Bit Manipulation](./bit-manipulation.md)
- [Bucket Sort](./bucket-sort.md)
- [DFS (Depth-First Search)](./dfs.md)
- [Design](./design.md)
- [Dynamic Programming](./dynamic-programming.md)
- [Fast & Slow Pointers](./fast-slow-pointers.md)
- [Graph](./graph.md)
- [Greedy](./greedy.md)
- [Heap](./heap.md)
- [In-place reversal of a linked list](./in-place-reversal-linked-list.md)
- [Intervals](./intervals.md)
- [QuickSelect](./quickselect.md)
- [Sliding Window](./sliding-window.md)
- [Sorting](./sorting.md)
- [Topological Sort](./topological-sort.md)
- [Trie](./trie.md)
- [Two Pointers](./two-pointers.md)
- [Union Find](./union-find.md)

## How to Use These Guides

1. **Start with the Core Concept**: Understand what the pattern is and why it exists
2. **Learn When to Use It**: Identify the problem characteristics that signal this pattern
3. **Study the Template**: Review the skeleton code to understand the structure
4. **Practice with Problems**: Work through the linked problems to reinforce your understanding
